The mini language is specified in a very clean and clear manner. I can only learn good things from these files.
 
 In the token.in file, i could find all the tokens - used later in the language, as seen in the Syntax.in file.
 Also, nothing was omitted in the Lexic.txt file. 
 
 Overall, i personally consider my colleague's laboratory work an impressive one.
